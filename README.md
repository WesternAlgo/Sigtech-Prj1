## Tutorial for dowloading NASDAQ ITCH data

#### Run imports.py, within the code you can select the specific day of trading to download by visiting <<'https://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/Nasdaq%20ITCH/'>>

#### Next run processing.py . This program sets up the code to download the data and label it. Note, the size of the file is quite large (~7GB). Once the data is downloaded this sequence of program should not have to be run anymore. To know if you completed the steps correctly, a graph should be outputted with showcasing the volumes traded for each company. (Not exactly sure how it will show when it's run through .py program instead of jupyter).

#### For further reference, look at the github provided by the textbook. https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-for-Algorithmic-Trading-Second-Edition/blob/master/02_market_and_fundamental_data/01_NASDAQ_TotalView-ITCH_Order_Book/01_parse_itch_order_flow_messages.ipynb


### To download the data that will be used to play around with the orderbook around, run the import.py file in an empty directory. That will download the data in the h5 format.
